<!-- Features and Functionalities-->

## 💻 Features

Key Features: Local Storage for Form Data

- Automatic Data Preservation: The implemented local storage functionality ensures that user-entered data in the form is automatically saved. Even if users navigate away from the page or accidentally refresh it, their input remains intact, providing a seamless experience.

- Persistent User Sessions: Users can return to the form at a later time and find their previously entered data still available. This feature eliminates the need for users to re-enter information, enhancing user satisfaction and convenience.
